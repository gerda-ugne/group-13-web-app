  <h3>2. Carry reusable cutlery</h3>
<p>Many people around the world use plastic cutlery like straws which have a negative impact on the environment. A solution to this is to use an alternative like bamboo or metal. This not only helps the environment but can also be used repeatedly, which saves money. Simply store some reusable cutlery in your bag the next time you go out so you can easily say no to disposable ones.</p>

  <h3>3. Buy loose fruit and veg</h3>
<p>Selling fruit and veg in plastic packaging is not a good way to preserve the environment which is sadly something many shops still do. Fruit and veg have their own packaging so you don't really need to put them in plastic bags. By shopping locally in greengrocers and zero waste you put money back into your local community instead of big corporate companies.</p>

    <h3>4. Switch to soap bar</h3>
<p>Soaps are a great alternative to shower gel as it lasts longer which making it cost effective and it can also be bought with no packaging. Of course, try not to but any bar that comes in plastic as that defeats the purpose. A good choice of soap is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SmelleezSoap/" style ="color:green" target="_blank">Smeleez.</a> They provide many amazing scents and their products come packaged in compostable materials. You could buy a soap bag so you won't drop your bar. Also, you could put any scrappy bit of soap in your bag so nothing will go to waste. You can buy a soap bag at The Little Green Larder!</p>

<h3>5. Use what you have</h3>
<br>
<p>This is a pretty straight forward tip. Just use what you already have! One of the worst things you can do is throw out all of your plastic and buy wooden/metal replacements. While these things are better for the environment, it will be wasteful not make a use for plastic before discarding it. For example, if you had a takeaway, keep the containers to use for lunch. Try finding a second or third purpose for the things you already have so you don't need to buy anything new yet.</p>

<h3>6. Eat less meat</h3>
<br>
<p>This may sound difficult for meat lovers but it's not as hard as you'd think. You could try making a day where you don't have anything e.g. Meat-free Monday. It is a lot better for you and the environment and is also a much cheaper alternative. Veggie and vegan lifestyles are becoming increasingly popular so give it a chance! Next time you go out, try a vegan restaurant and you won't be unimpressed.</p>

<h3>7. Walk, cycle or catch a bus</h3>
<br>
<p>While using a car is an everday requiremnt for most people. They tend to unecessarily use them for journeys where they could've just walked. Cars are a huge factor on climate change and is becoming a serious issue due to the amount of pollution. So next time you plan on nipping to the shops or going to town, try walking or cycling; it's always good to get some exercise!</p>

  <h3>9. Buy second hand</h3>
<p>Second hand doesn't mean second best. You can get lots of amazing good-as-new things in charity shops, car boot sales and vintage fairs etc. Nowadays, millions of products end up in landfill which seriously harm the environment. Buying second hand is a good way to prevent this. The quality can still be great and it would save money as well. Check out Jillian's blog to learn how second hand purchasing can be fun! <a href="http://thelittlegreenblogger.com/index.php/2019/09/01/im-doing-second-hand-september/" style ="color:green" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a></p>

  <h3>10. Stop buying drinks in plastic bottles</h3>
<p>Almost everywhere you look, you will find a plastic bottle littered. Parks, beaches and the streets are covered in them and hardly any of them end up recycled. The best solution for this is to own a refillable bottle. Just buy a glass bottle and keep that as your hold your drinks. If you want a fizzy drink, opt for a glass bottle or can and make sure you put it in the appropriate bin. If you want a reliable reusable bottle, have a look at <a href="https://www.jedz.co.uk/" style ="color:green" target="_blank">Jedz bottles.</a> They keep your cold drinks cold for 24 hours and your hot drinks hot for 12 hours.</p>
